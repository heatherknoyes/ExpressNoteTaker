## Description

The motivation for this project was to implement the backend of a pre-existing code base so that a fully functional app was created. I utilized Express.js for my middleware and used Node as the package manager. I was also able to deploy this application to Heroku so that the live application can be see by the world. The thing I'm most proud of for this project is not the functionality itself, but all of the tools that I learned along the way like Heroku/Insomnia/Javascript Debug within VSCode. I know those skills will be transferrable in the future. Potentially in the future I would like to integrate this site with a backend database so that each time it is generated a file on the computer does not grow. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user story and acceptance criteria.
